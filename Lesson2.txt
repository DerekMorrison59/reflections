What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git (hidden) directory is created to store all the git related files
You must create an empty repository before you can perform a commit


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is really a subset of the list of files in the cwd that will be included in the next commit.
This provides an easy way to combine a logical grouping of files together for a single commit. (like .html and .css combo)
