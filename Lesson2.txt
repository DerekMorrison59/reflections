What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git (hidden) directory is created to store all the git related files
You must create an empty repository before you can perform a commit


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is really a subset of the list of files in the cwd that will be included in the next commit.
This provides an easy way to combine a logical grouping of files together for a single commit. (like .html and .css combo)


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Add all files involved in the logical change to the staging area and then commit them as a group


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When you need to create 2 versions of a project, like master and experimental (try out a new feature)
Make a new exp brach and keep all of those changes seperate from the main code base


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It is very clear when each branch left the master and how far each branch has gone 


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

All changes made in the branch are now inserted / added to the main (master) code base.
Because each seperate path on the diagram contains it's own version of the code, they don't have to merge again
