When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* to share with other people
* to keep a backup incase of *oops*
* to be able to get a copy of my own code on a different computer


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* you might get a bunch of code that you don't want from the remote
* it's hard to make local changes if Git is always trying to keep up-to-date with the remote
* your local copy might become unexpectedly broken
